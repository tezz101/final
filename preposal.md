# Preproposal
hello
## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Web Scraper: Build a tool that scrapes information from websites and presents it in a useful format. This could range from a job listing aggregator to a scraper that gathers data for academic research.

Data Visualization App: Create an application that takes in large datasets and creates interactive charts and graphs. This could be particularly appealing if you're into data science.

Machine Learning Model: Develop a simple machine learning model, for instance, to categorize news articles or predict movie ratings based on user reviews.

Text Adventure Game: A classic project that can be as simple or complex as you like. Create a game that runs in the terminal, where players make choices and navigate through a story you write.

Budget Tracker/Finance Manager: Create a personal finance application that tracks income and expenses, categorizes them, and provides reports on spending habits.

Educational Tool for Kids: Develop an interactive learning module for children, like a simple arithmetic quiz game, a spelling practice tool, or a geography quiz.

Home Automation System:  write a script to automate tasks at home, like managing lights, temperature, or even feeding pets, using a Raspberry Pi.

Health and Fitness Tracker: Create an application where users can log their exercise routines, meals, or meditations and track their progress over time.

API Development: Develop your own API for a task or service that interests you, such as a booking system for a local service or an information hub for public transport in your city.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Implement a simple NLP project, like a chatbot that can perform specific tasks or answer questions on a particular subject.
